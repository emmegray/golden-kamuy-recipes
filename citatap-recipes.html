            <h3>How to make it:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Salmon head, milt, and remains from filleting are placed on a cutting board-like round piece of wood
                    sliced from a tree
                    trunk (itatani). The meat is chopped and beaten with a sharp heavy object, such as a hatchet.</li>
                <li>Strain bonito out, season with salt, and then add in white parts of the leeks, sliced on an angle
                    and washed.</li>
                <li>The resulting paste is flavored with minced spring onion, pukusa, or long-stamen chive.</li>
                <li>Finally, the citatap is seasoned with dried kelp and salt.</li>
            </ol>
            Other than salmon, a variety of meats and fish are used to add flavor to citatap such as Japanese dace,
            bathyraja
            lindbergi, masu salmon, Japanese fluvial sculpin, deer, bear, tanuki, rabbit, and chipmunk. Citatap was well
            suited to
            the meat of older animals, as it made the tough meat easier to eat. Citatap was primarily made
            in the
            winter, when food spoiled more slowly, and was eaten over a number of days. If the citatap was not
            particularly fresh,
            it was formed into balls and added to soup
